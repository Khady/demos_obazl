= modules_without_implementation

If a lib stanza contains sigs listed in
`modules_without_implementation`, Dune compiles them and
creates an empty archive, no namespacing.

If the lib stanza also contains .ml modules, dune _also_ creates a
namespaced lib and includes it in the archive. The archive contains
the modules, not the "modules_without_implementation" (sigfiles).

If a lib depends on such a lib, to use the sigfiles the stanza must
contain a 'copy' to copy the sigfiles listed in
'modules_without_implementation' into the depending library and
compile them there.

However dune does compile the sigfiles in-place.

Bazel: one ocaml_signature target per file listed in
`modules_without_implementation`. If modules are also listed, treat
the library just like any other.

Client libs that want to depend on such stuff can then reference the
sigs by label; no need for a copy action.

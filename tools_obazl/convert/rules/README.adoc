= rules and actions

According to the doc, rule syntax is:

(rule
 (target[s] <filenames>)
 (action  <action>)
 <optional-fields>)

Sadly, the tests in dune's source code say differently. The 'action
wrapper can be omitted. For example:

(rule
  (action (with-stdout-to ...)))

or

(rule
  (with-stdout-to ...))

So we split them into actions and cmds, the latter omitting the 'action wrapper.

= bash actions

We cannot expect to be able to parse inline shell scripts and infer
dependencies and outputs, so instead of emiting one genrule for such
actions we emit two targets:

* a genrule that emits a shell script containing the inline code
* a sh_binary target that runs the shell script

For example, (action (bash "...script...")) would become something like

genrule(name = "__foo__", outs = ["genscript.sh"], cmd_bash =  "...script...", executable=True)

sh_binary(name = "genscript", srcs=["genscript.sh"]...)

To make this work we need to process the inline script before emitting
it, since it may contain dune %{} variables.  For example:

 (action (bash "cat %{deps}/*"))

 (action (bash "mkdir %{targets}"))

(action  (bash "cp `grep '^ARCH=' %{conf} | cut -d'=' -f2`/*.ml ."))

 (bash "%{dep:../tools/make_opcodes.exe} -opcodes < %{instr} > %{targets}")

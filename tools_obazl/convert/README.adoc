== dev mode

`$ bazel run @obazl//batch -- path/to/target`

This will load `mibl.scm` and run its `main` routine.

Some packages have out-of-scope depencies; they depend on files in
directories that are not descendants. So if you try to convert them
singly you'll get an error. You have to convert an ancestor directory
that has everything needed in scope. But that means all the packages
in scope will be converted so you gete a lot of output you don't need.
You can restrict the scope by adding "exclude" entries to .config/miblrc.

For example, deps/glob/super depends on deps/glob/css. See comments
in .config/miblrc for instructions on how to convert it.

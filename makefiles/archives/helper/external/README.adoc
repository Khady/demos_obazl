= archives - helper

This demo is the same as demo `archives/links`, except that we add a
"helper" module, so that the modules in the archive depend on a module
outside of the archive.

In this case we do not put the helper in the archive, so we have to
provide it (.cmi, .cmx, ,o) when we link an executable that uses the archive.

= makefiles

These examples demonstrate the OCaml build discipline using makefiles.

The demos in the link:makefiles[makefiles] directory depend on an
link:https://opam.ocaml.org/[OPAM] installation with the following
packages installed:

* findlib
* ounit2

To start from scratch, install OPAM and then:

```
$ opam update
$ opam switch create 4.14.0
$ eval $(opam env)
$ opam install ounit2
```

This will also install findlib.

You can tell OPAM to list the packages installed in the current
switch: `$ opam  list`.

Run `make` from the top directory or any of the subdirectories. Some
of the targets are expected to fail, as illustration of some aspect of
OCaml builds. Most demos are documented in the Makefiles and/or README
files.

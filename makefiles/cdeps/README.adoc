= cdeps

Demonstrates that compile-time module dependencies can be resolved
with cmi files only. If the cmx file is missing, the compiler will
issue a warning but the compile will succeed. In this demo we don't
even have file `b.ml`, we only have `b.mli`. Nonetheless, we can
compile module A, which depends on B.

`$ make`

Expected result:

* emits: `b.cmi`, `a.cmi`, `a.cmx`, `a.o`
* prints: `Warning 58 [no-cmx-file]: no cmx file was found in path for module B, and its interface was not compiled with -opaque`

However, if we then try to link the compiled module `A` into an
executable the compiler will throw an exception:

`$ make exe`

Expected result: as above,plus:

----
`Error: No implementations provided for the following modules:
         B referenced from a.cmx
----

= rules_ocaml demos

== Getting started

With a local switch:

0. `$ opam update`

1. `$ opam switch import opam.local --switch .`

2. `$ bazel run @opam//local:refresh`

3. `$ bazel test test`

With a shared switch:

1. `$ opam switch import opam.local --switch obazl_demos` - creates a new switch named `obazl_demos`

2. `$ bazel run @opam//shared:refresh`

3. `$ bazel test test`

If you get errors involving missing "@something..." it probably means
your local switch/coswitch is misconfigured. Try rerunning

`$ bazel run @opam//local:refresh`.

NOTE: If you would like to contribute a demo, please
file an issue first. Demos should illustrate one concept, using
minimal code. They should not require the user to install or configure
any other software, unless that is the point of the demo.

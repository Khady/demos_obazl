# makefiles

These examples demonstrate the OCaml build discipline using makefiles.

Some of them use the ounit2 unit testing package. You must install it in the current switch. This also installs ocamlfind.

```
$ opam install ocamlfind ounit2
```

You can tell OPAM to list the packages installed in the current
switch: `$ opam  list`.

Make sure you run `$ eval $(opam env)`.
